# Testing Plan

## Part I. Description of Overall Test Plan
To ensure a high quality end product, we are planning on testing all of the backend components of the IDE with mock data for normal, abnormal and boundary tests. We will create test cases for each feature before and after implementation to ensure that we satisfy requirements and ensure our implementation works smoothly (black and whitebox testing) and test each component individually and in conjunction (unit and integration testing). We also want to ensure that the application not only works, but meets certain non-functional requirements such as running the FRIL code quickly and efficiently or building an intuitive and customizable interface. We will develop performance tests for qualities like speed and conduct user testing to measure and gauge these attributes.
