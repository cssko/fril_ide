# Final Design Report
## Project Description 
Logic programming is a paradigm for expressing and using formal logic. It is used in Artificial Intelligence. When we were introduced to FRIL (a logic programming language from the 1980â€™s) by our AI professor, it was hard to pick concepts due to a lack of educational tools for the language. For our project, we developed an IDE for FRIL to help students learning artificial intelligence.
