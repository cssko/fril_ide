Self -Reflection Essay

An extensive amount of my contribution to Senior Design was providing documentation and completing individual assignments. Specific assignments involved providing assistance with user stories, a task list, and constructing a milestone and a timeline. I worked with my group to write the content for the project video. I assisted with constructing ideas of how to create the wireframe UI for the future deign. The second term involved providing support for documenting the test plan as well as constructing the user documentation. Reviewing the Capstone Assessment, I do not think I did as much of the extent that I expected to do in the context of building the IDE. I mainly chose to assist in just providing the documentation.

I learned about the importance of communication and the ability to look for effective and useful resources. I also learned the importance of asking for help when there are limitations in completing an assigned task. I learned about the various benefits of using a cross-platform application such as qt creator and the utilities used in making a widget application. I learned how to become more competent in providing required documentation, effective usage of visuals, and complete designs. I was able to succeed in providing sufficient documentation, and in communication. My biggest obstacle involved uncertainty about how to approach a solution when developing a design.
