## Project Background
Programming has many different paradigms. The most popular paradigm is object-oriented programming and most students are introduced to it early on in their education. However, when it comes to other programming paradigms, like logic programming there is little support and they are harder to pick up. Logic programming is gaining traction again due to the interest in creating explainable AI. When we were introduced to FRIL by a professor, it was hard to pick up logic programming because there were no education tools that supported the language and guided us through the main ideas of logic programming. 

We will be developing an IDE that will help improve the learning curve of the FRIL language. The IDE will have syntax highlighting, code formatting, instructor videos, built-in help, and embedded FRIL.

## Problem Statement 
FRIL is an important logic programming language because it is more succinct than other languages, but provides powerful operations. However, FRIL has no supportive development environment at all. Learning the concepts of logic programming becomes harder and longer for students and the essential concepts of logic programming are lost. It takes longer to run successful programs in FRIL - due to limited resources and writing code on a standard text editor. 

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Programming languages like Prolog have more support than FRIL but are more tedious to use. There is no current solution because an IDE for FRIL simply does not exist. In addition, all the existing IDEâ€™s for Prolog do not highlight concepts of logic programming and this is not functionality we could support for existing solutions either. Formatting errors and improper syntax are hard to detect when running code in the Fril interpreter.

## Background Skills/ Interests Related to the Project
All three individuals contributing to this project have used the FRIL language and have a basic understanding of the concepts of logic programming. Each person has different interests including the following
* FRIL
* Front-end development
* QtCreator/ C++
* HTML/CSS 
* Agile Methodology
* Computer Science Education
* Backend Development
* Prolog

## Approach to Problem
The overall goal of our project is to create an IDE for a logic programming language that facilitates understanding fundamental concepts of logic programming (like the existence of a knowledge base) and reduces the learning curve in programming in these languages through functionality including syntax highlighting, code formatting and instructor videos.
