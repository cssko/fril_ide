# Final Design Report

## Project Abstract
Logic programming is a programming paradigm for expressing and using formal logic. It is used in Artificial Intelligence and is a declarative way of analyzing a problem. When we were introduced to FRIL by a professor, it was hard to pick up logic programming because there were no education tools that supported the language and guided us through the main ideas of logic programming. We will be developing an IDE that will help improve the learning curve of the FRIL language. The IDE will have syntax highlighting, code formatting, instructor videos, built-in help, and embedded FRIL as well as query visualization to improve studentsâ€™ experiences.

## Budget
There has not been any expenses so far.

## Appendix
References, citations, links to code repos we will be using, meeting notes, evidence of 45 hours of effort per team member 

We met 3-6 hours every week of the semester during senior design time or made up for it with individual research on our own outside class every week. Apart from the many hours we put into weekly meetings, design assignments and discussions, we have also done the following.

* We obtained and have analyzed the FRIL source code. We have been annotating the FRIL source code. We will not be uploading this because we are still clearing the rights.
* We also have conducted [surveys](https://forms.gle/uctZsjZQ9U1MxSX9A) among current AI students to understand what features that they think would benefit them as well as understand what concepts are less intuitive
* We created a UI wire frame for the IDE.
* We did more research on logic programming and the educational outcomes we would like for the IDE.	
* We compiled the artificial intelligence course material.
* We decided and implemented project set-up and team practices including contribution guidelines for our open source project.
* We decided on our IDE name and and have created logo designs for the project.
* We also have a basic Qt project for the IDE ready which we will be uploading to this repository soon.
